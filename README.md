Features:
---------

- Supports all of the power saving modes of the SCD40/SCD41
- Simple C++ class with a minimum of methods
- Portable code runs on Arduino, Linux and esp-idf

I wrote this because the existing SCD41 libraries didn't do what I needed - specifically I wanted to communicate with the sensor on a random set of GPIO pins using bit banging. By using my BitBang_I2C library, this library can talk to the sensor in a more flexible way.
